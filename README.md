# paddy-mern

This project has two purposes:
1. Let me learn about the MERN stack
2. Replace a spreadsheet I use at my workplace that coordinates tasks between a inter-state locations. Tasks need to be allocated from a central location. Information needs to flow back from task recipient to advise either further action or all happy.
