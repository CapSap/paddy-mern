# paddy-mern

This project has two purposes:
1. Let me learn about the MERN stack
2. Replace a spreadsheet I use at my workplace that coordinates online click and collect orders between physical stores located inter-state. Tasks need to be allocated centrally and information needs to flow back from task recipients to advise either further action or all happy.   

Jan update: I've messed around abit and now will start project again on paddy-mern-2
