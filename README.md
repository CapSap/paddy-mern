# paddy-mern

This project has two purposes:
1. Let me learn about the MERN stack
2. Replace a spreadsheet I use at my workplace that coordinates online click and collect orders between physical stores located inter-state. Tasks need to be allocated from a central location. Information needs to flow back from task recipient to advise either further action or all happy.
